                    Hi there! I'm Ethan.
                    I am currently a first-year student at Cal Poly SLO. I am studying Computer Science and I additionally intend to pursue a minor in Data Science. My career aspirations are to work with data and possibly in the world of fintech.
                    In addition to programming, some of my interests include playing video games, spending time with friends, and performing with Cal Poly's Lion Dance Team. I also spend time with my dog in the picture, Colby, my 5 year-old Chihuahua mix.
                    I really hope you find something that you find cool, fun, or interesting on my site. Please do get in contact with me for any suggestions or concerns you have.
                    Thanks for visiting!
